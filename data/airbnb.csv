Big, beautiful home with a woodsy view, patio, fenced yard, and luxe furnishings right in the historic heart of Santa Fe! Puertas de Canyon Road is probably named for its hop-skip-jump access to the famous half-mile of galleries, shops, restaurants, and historic sites, but you could also take the word ""doors"" literally. There are multiple doors in this lovely home, including glass doubles and sliders leading out to the charming brick patio and big, friendly yard. Santa Fe's enviable weather makes indoor-outdoor living a reality almost year-round, and you'll love sitting on the covered patio watching the snow or at the ironwork, table soaking in the sun! Like the city itself, Puertas de Canyon Road is never out of season -- making it a great destination for your pet as well as your family! Step into the entryway of Puertas de Canyon Road and you immediately know you're going to love it here. The big living room is dominated by a traditional mantel fireplace surrounded by cushy armchairs and a couch that opens into a queen-sized sleeper. A large flat-screen TV stands at the ready in one corner and a desk in another, but the furniture is arranged for conversation and fun. Wood flooring and open beams add a coziness to this room, and a wide bank of sliding glass doors lets sunshine spill in from the patio. You're home -- and if your dog is with you, you can watch that wagging tail exploring the yard from the comfort of your armchair! The first order of business may be snacks and drinks for everyone, and you will find Puertas de Canyon Road quite convenient in helping you prepare without having to leave the action in the living room. A wide breakfast bar divides kitchen from living room, with several stools for the ankle-biters in your group. Set them coloring or playing as you whip up tasty nibbles and delicious drinks! This is a full working kitchen, so all you need bring is groceries. Whether you're making on-the-go snacks or preparing homemade feasts from scratch, Puertas de Canyon Road is equal to the task. Pots and pans? -- Check. Cooking tools and gizmos of every description? -- Check. Dishes, flatware, and glasses to spare? -- Double check! And more importantly, you have a dishwasher in which to toss everything! Whether you're just grabbing coffee and toast in the morning or using the fine produce at Santa Fe's farmer's market to concoct an unforgettable meal, you'll find the kitchen a pleasure to use. A charming wooden table beside a sideboard seats 6 comfortably beneath a modern chandelier, with a nice view through yet more sliding doors. Make this your command center: it's great for setting up laptops, laying out a puzzle, or playing a wild round of Uno after dinner. Of course, you can also use it for meals, but if it's not snowing, you just might have to carry those outdoors for a little al fresco dining! You won't want your evening at Puertas de Canyon Road to end, but when you must retire to bed, one glance at the accommodations shows you that you're in for a great night's sleep. Both bedrooms have king-sized beds because nobody really wants anything less. The master suite includes a big flat-screen TV (classic movie channel, anyone?!), two very plump and roomy reading chairs, and something you won't find in most Santa Fe homes: carpeting! The en-suite bath includes a tiled shower and tub combo, a decorated ceramic basin, and all the towels you could wish, plus extras. (Linens and pillows are provided, too.) The second bedroom is dominated by the king-sized bed and a wall-long entertainment center, complete with a flat-screen TV for your enjoyment. In another corner stands a Mission-style chair, and there is plenty of closet and storage space here. This bedroom shares a full bath (with walk-in shower and decorative tiling) with the living area of the house. You will also find a washer and dryer tucked away at Puertas de Canyon Road -- we've thought of everything! You will love exploring the outdoor spaces here too.
