    "# The Reuters corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisit the Reuters C50 text corpus that we briefly explored in class. Your task is simple: tell an interesting story, anchored in some analytical tools we have learned in this class, using this data. For example:\n",
    "- you could cluster authors or documents and tell a story about what you find.\n",
    "- you could look for common factors using PCA.\n",
    "- you could train a predictive model and assess its accuracy, constructing features for each document that maximize performance.\n",
    "- you could do anything else that strikes you as interesting with this data.\n",
    "- Describe clearly what question you are trying to answer, what models you are using, how you pre-processed the data, and so forth. Make sure you include at least one really interesting plot (although more than one might be necessary, depending on your question and approach.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Format your write-up in the following sections, some of which might be quite short:\n",
    "- Question: What question(s) are you trying to answer?\n",
    "- Approach: What approach/statistical tool did you use to answer the questions?\n",
    "- Results: What evidence/results did your approach provide to answer the questions? (E.g. any numbers, tables, figures as appropriate.)\n",
    "- Conclusion: What are your conclusions about your questions? Provide a written interpretation of your results, understandable to stakeholders who might plausibly take an interest in this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the data itself: In the C50train directory, you have 50 articles from each of 50 different authors (one author per directory). Then in the C50test directory, you have another 50 articles from each of those same 50 authors (again, one author per directory). This train/test split is obviously intended for building predictive models, but to repeat, you need not do that on this problem. You can tell any story you want using any methods you want. Just make it compelling!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you try to build a predictive model, you will need to figure out a way to deal with words in the test set that you never saw in the training set. This is a nontrivial aspect of the modeling exercise. (E.g. you might simply ignore those new words.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This question will be graded according to three criteria:\n",
    "- the overall \"interesting-ness\" of your question and analysis.\n",
    "- the clarity of your description. We will be asking ourselves: could your analysis be reproduced by a competent data scientist based on what you've said? (That's good.) Or would that person have to wade into the code in order to understand what, precisely, you've done? (That's bad.)\n",
    "- technical correctness (i.e. did you make any mistakes in execution or interpretation?)"

    "First step was just making sure the data was migrated correctly. I wanted to make sure there were no missing articles or authors, and that the files were set up correctly. This script simply goes into the folder, checks that there are 50 authors in each of the train and test set, then confirms that each author has 50 articles associated with them. Doesn't check the contents of any files, just the overall structure."
